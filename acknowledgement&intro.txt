conclusion 
	
	This system provides users to search easily CU (Mdy) theses from 2008-2016 with abstract .
Our project has a weakness. It doesn’t show full data of all thesis because our data are collected from CU (Mdy)
 library and there is no soft copy of theses. 
	But we make our ETD system to find global theses and dissertations for more reference. 
Users can search 5,111,718 electronic theses and dissertations at Global ETD site where can find any fields that you want .
	At admin panel, admin can create, retrieve, update and delete data from firebase database. 
And also do permissions for login users.
	For our project future plan, we aim to do more useful site for our university.
We want to make from ETD mini project to CU (Mdy) e-Library.
